  Download the <a href="#">latest release</a> and add this to your page:

  If your script should be loaded in the `<head>` tag,
  set `insertInHead: true` and the instructions will update according.

  Targets are the instruction pages for each type of CMS.
  Targets will use broad “global” option unless a target specific “local” option is set.


:marked
  In this example all targets except Weebly will use the same `embedCode`.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/advanced.md")

:marked
  A target's support for `embedCode` and <a href="#downloads">`downloadURL`</a> is dependant on it's internal `policy` property.

table#target-policies
  thead
    tr
      th.id ID
      th.global-embed-code Global <code>embedCode</code>
      th.local-embed-code Local <code>embedCode</code>
      th.download-url <code>downloadURL</code>
  tbody
    tr

:marked
  While a target may support multiple options, each may have a unqiue behavior.

  Targets that support plugins such as `wordpress` will assume the `downloadURL` is package for the user to install using the CMS.

  Targets like `generic` and `weebly` assume the `downloadURL` is a JavaScript library that is downloaded and installed using an `embedCode`

  Targets are populated in the `EmbedBox.fetchedTargets` array.

  `EmbedBox.getTargetIDs()` can be used to programatically get the bundled target IDs if desired.

+codeExample(false, "target-ids")!= require("./examples/get-target-ids.md")

+anchored("h3", "Downloads")
:marked
  A `downloadURL` can be used for sending users CMS plugins or libraries.
  If you'd like to use `downloadURL` with the `generic` target, include a local `embedCode` to guide the user.

  Specifying a `downloadURL` will start an automatic download when a target is selected.
  Set `autoDownload: false` to disable to this behavior.

  >Is your download a JavaScript file? Compress it in as a zip file to ensure the download automatically starts in all browsers!

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/download-url.md")

+anchored("h3", "Positioning")
:marked
  EmbedBox can appear inline by specifying `container` in the config.
  This can be a CSS selector.

+codeExample!= require("./examples/container-selector.md")

:marked
  ...or an HTML element.

+codeExample!= require("./examples/container-element.md")

+anchored("h3", "Behavior")
:marked
  EmbedBox will automatically appear on creation.
  This can be disabled with the `autoShow` option.

+codeExample()!= require("./examples/auto-show.md")

:marked
  The target search screen can be skipped with `initialTarget`.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/initial-target.md")

:marked
  Set <a href="#ordering" class="without-underline">`visibleTargets`</a>
  to disable the target search entirely.

+anchored("h3", "Routing")
:marked
  EmbedBox will look at `#!/embed/:targetID` when created and route accordingly.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/routing.md")

:marked
  This can be disbled with the `routing` option.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/disabled-routing.md")

+anchored("h2", "Customization")
+anchored("h3", "Themes")
+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/custom-theme.md")

:marked
  If the `theme` configuration option is too coarse,
  the EmbedBox stylesheet can be extended.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/custom-stylesheet.md")

+anchored("h3", "Content slots")
:marked
  Content can be inserted before and after the target instructions.

  Target specific slots can be included as well.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/content-slots.md")

+anchored("h3", "Labels")
:marked
  Labels can be added as strings or functions.
  The EmbedBox `config` is exposed to label functions.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/labels.md")

+anchored("h3", "Ordering")
:marked
  Targets can be sorted with the `order` option.
  A target will remain in the original order if not specified.
  Set `order: -1` to disable a target entirely.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/ordering.md")

:marked
  The target search will be skipped if only one target is visible.

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/single-target.md")

+anchored("h3", "Custom targets")
:marked
  If the content slots are too coarse, custom targets can be created with the custom build.

+codeExample!= require("./examples/custom-install.md")

+codeExample(true)!= require("./examples/custom-target.md")

  Please do, we would love for this to become a project of the community.
  Feel free to open an issue, submit a PR or contribute to the docs.

  Is there a CMS target that you'd like to see here?
